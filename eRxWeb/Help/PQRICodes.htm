<br /><br />
Are you participating in the voluntary Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) for Medicare? Are you keying PQRI Quality Data Codes (QDCs) on your charges? Are you receiving an N365 Denial Remark Code on your Explanation of Medicare Benefits (EOMB)? 
<br /><br />
If you are submitting these zero $ service codes and not receiving the N365 Denial Remark Codes on your EOMBs then your codes are not reaching Medicare and you should take immediate action.   
<br /><br />
The following information will help you verify that Medicare is receiving your PQRI Quality-Data Codes (QDCs.), including the G-codes used for ePrescribing.
<br /><br />
The most important thing you can do to be sure that Medicare is receiving and recognizing your QDCs is to regularly review your Remittance Advice Notices. Currently QDCs are returned on a Remittance Advice with a Denial Code of N365 which indicates “This procedure code is not payable. It is for reporting/information purposes only.” This is a denial you want to see because it means that Medicare has processed your QDCs - not seeing this N365 Denial it means that Medicare is not receiving your QDCs.
<br /><br />
If you are not seeing the N365 Denial, please first check that your data entry representative(s) are not manually suppressing the $0.00 (zero dollar) line items.  You’ll want to make sure the $0.00 (zero dollars) line items are present on your Medicare claims.  
<br /><br />
If you’re unsure about your Practice Management PQRI setup and are not receiving the N365 Remark Codes on your Explanation of Medicare Benefits (EOMB)
contact Client Support for your Practice Management system immediately for assistance with your PQRI setup.
